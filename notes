#is each user a follower of themselves? Will their own posts show up on their feed?

#create "bocking user" functionality
For example, we have not elected to support the ability to block users. 
This would add one more layer of complexity to our queries, since now we not 
only need to grab the posts of the users we follow, but we need to filter out those from users that decided to block us. How would you implement this? Simple, 
one more many-to-many self-referential relationship to record who's blocking who, and one more join+filter in the query that returns the followed posts.

#custom lists
Another popular feature in social networks is the ability to group followers into custom lists, and then sharing content only with specific groups. 
This is also implemented with additional relationships and added complexity to the queries.

#duplicate database entries if user refreshes page after POST
Without the redirect, the last request is the POST request that submitted the form, so a refresh action will resubmit the form, 
causing a second Post record that is identical to the first to be written to the database. Not good.
